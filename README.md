A simple bot designed to handle communications from discord to openai language models and generate responses, open to customization.

Requirements:

A discord account with access to developer portal (https://discord.com/developers/)
A open-ai account with access to a api key, paid or free it doesn't matter



Features:

- NRAF Character File (write character traits into the file named "character.cfg" to personalize the bot to your needs)

- Auto-Wipe (auto wiping options so that the bot can handle multiple queries without repeating the chat history and responding to all, also good to find more bypasses)

- Base64 (send/decode messages in Base64 to try a basic bypass)
  
- Temperature Adjustment (increase the randomness/accuracy in answers on the fly)
  
- Model Changing (change the language model from openai to adjust to your needs)
  
- Sleep Functions
  
- General Security Features (heartbeat, ping, endpoint checking and geoIP commands)
